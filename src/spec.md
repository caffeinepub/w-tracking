# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Show the existing app logo on the landing/empty-state screen before a user searches for a location.

**Planned changes:**
- Add the existing logo image (`/assets/generated/weather-logo.dim_512x512.png`) to the empty-state screen UI (in addition to the header).
- Ensure the logo has appropriate English alt text and is positioned responsively without overlapping the hero image, text, or Search button.

**User-visible outcome:** When the app first loads, users see the app logo on the empty-state screen, laid out cleanly on both mobile and desktop.
