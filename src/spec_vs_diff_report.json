  "summary": "Core weather search, selection, fetching via React Query, and contextual advice appear implemented. However, the first-load UX shows an empty-state screen with a button rather than immediately showing a location input form as required. The diff also adds Internet Identity/auth and actor-related hooks that were not requested in the BuildRequest.",
